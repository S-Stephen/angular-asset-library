# TestLocllib

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.8.

It shows the ability to produce a component library (projects/campl-ngx) which can be included in an application and where the style will become global (inherited from the component library).

- Start the development server
- Build the library (ie copy in to the dist location)

Edit and investigate the effects of changes to the libarary etc

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Build the library

Run `ng build campl-ng --watch` to build the library The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. When the library files are modified the application should based on the particular library modifications.
